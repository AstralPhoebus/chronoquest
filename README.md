## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chronoquest.git
cd chronoquest
```

### 2. Set up Firebase
- Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/
- Enable **Authentication** (Email/Password)
- Create a **Firestore** database
- Get your **Web App config** (for frontend) and **Admin SDK** (for backend)

### 3. Set up Gemini API
- Get a Gemini API key from Google AI Studio (https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

### 4. Set up Email (SendGrid)
- Create a SendGrid account and get an API key
- Verify your sender email address

### 5. Environment Variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in all required values:

```
# Backend (Vercel Serverless Functions)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-api-key-here
EMAIL_FROM=your-verified-sender@example.com
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-firebase-adminsdk-email
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your-firebase-adminsdk-private-key (use \n for newlines)

# Frontend (React Native, Expo)
# (No secrets should be exposed here)
```

For the frontend, update `frontend/constants/firebaseConfig.js` with your Firebase Web App config.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Running Locally

### Backend (API)
- Deployed automatically by Vercel from `/api` directory
- For local dev: use [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) or run with `node`/`vercel dev`

### Frontend (Expo App)
```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npx expo start
```
- Scan the QR code with Expo Go (iOS/Android)
- Or run on an emulator/simulator

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes
- **Never expose API keys or secrets in the frontend.**
- All AI and email API calls are made from the backend only.
- Firebase Auth tokens are used to secure all API endpoints.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Deployment
- Deploy the root project to Vercel. The `/api` folder is auto-routed as serverless functions.
- The frontend (Expo) can be built and published via Expo or bundled as a static web app for Vercel.
